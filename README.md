An ecommerce website for purchasing vegetables 

vegetables.json incldues all of the vegetables that a user can purchase.
	Corn
	Carrots
	Soybeans

index.html contains the home page of the site.  This is where users can see what items are for sale.

my_cart.html contains the users cart.

checkout.html is the page users will see when they hit checkout

vegetables_functions.js contains the functions used within my pages.
		to determine what's in the users cart, I stored what they purchased using localstorage
		

Instructions on file placement
	All files should be placed in the same folder.
	for this to work, local storage must be allowed
	
Final note:
	I'm assuming I'm not allowed to use css.  If I did use css, I'd make it much more aesthetically pleasing.
