# CH-Robinson-Vegetables
An ecommerce website for purchasing vegetables 

vegetables.json incldues all of the vegetables that a user can purchase.
	Current vegetables include:
	Corn, 
	Carrots, 
	Soybeans
	
	Each vegetable in the Json file must have 4 parts to it.  A name, price, description, and an image link.

index.html contains the home page of the site.  This is where users can see what items are for sale.

my_cart.html contains the users cart.

checkout.html is the page users will see when they hit checkout

vegetables_functions.js contains the functions used within my pages.
		to determine what's in the users cart, I stored what they purchased using localstorage

vegetables.css contains all the css used.	

Instructions on file placement
	All files should be placed in the same folder.
	for this to work, local storage must be allowed
	
Final note:
	I'm assuming I'm not allowed to use css.  If I did use css, I'd make it much more aesthetically pleasing.
